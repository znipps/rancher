# Rancher

Rancher is an open source project that provides a complete platform for operating Docker in production. It provides infrastructure services such as multi-host networking, global and local load balancing, and volume snapshots. It integrates native Docker management capabilities such as Docker Machine and Docker Swarm. It offers a rich user experience that enables devops admins to operate Docker in production at large scale.

## Installation

Rancher is deployed as a set of Docker containers.  Running Rancher is as simple as launching two containers.  One container as the management server and another container on a node as an agent.  You can install the containers in following approaches.

* [Manually](#launching-management-server)
* [Terraform](https://github.com/rancher/terraform-modules)
* [Puppet](https://github.com/nickschuch/puppet-rancher) (Thanks @nickschuch)
* [Ansible](https://github.com/joshuacox/ansibleplaybook-rancher)
* [SaltStack](https://github.com/komljen/rancher-salt)

### Requirements

* [Supported Docker version](http://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/hosts/#supported-docker-versions)
* Any modern Linux distribution with a [supported Docker version](http://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/hosts/#supported-docker-versions). (Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS 7 are more heavily tested.) Rancher also works with [RancherOS](https://github.com/rancher/os).
* RAM: 1GB+

### Launching Management Server
